## Global Family Care Network 
On a high level, we aimed to create a platform for the Global Family Care Network's Thrive Program to manage and create clubs, to dissemenate information for trafficking prevention, and to foster community amongst club leaders. Our main objective was to create a central and accessible resource for the girls in the Thrive Program. 

## Getting Started
Clone into your local repository and run ``npm install``. This should install all of the required dependencies to run our application.

## Technologies
We utilized ``node.js`` , ``express`` ``react-native`` and ``mongodb`` to create this application. Additionally, to aid in the development process, we installed ``nodemon``, so that the server automatically updates upon file changes. Our database securely houses basic information on members, leaders, and clubs.
## Challenges
Almost the entirety of our team had no experience with mobile development, so we learned React-Native together. We also switched databases throughout the development process, and faced setbacks with integrating our UI to the backend infrastructure.
